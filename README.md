rps-text.html fulfils the user stories and little more.
  - driven by keyboard input
  - will only play 5 rounds
  - a draw awards points to both players
  - however unlikely, it is possible to draw 3 rounds, giving both players a 'winning' score.

rps-gui.html goes a little further.
  - mouse driven
  - CSS Grid for UI
  - rps-gui.js DOM manipulation
    - EventListeners added by ClassName for player selection
    - Update scores
    - Commentary field updates based on scores    
    - Changes display property to show result of round
